# Codesoft-tasks
"This repository contains the solutions to the tasks assigned during my internship at Codsoft. The objective of this task is to develop a To-Do List application using Python, either as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to create, update, and manage their to-do lists efficiently, helping them stay organized and productive."
